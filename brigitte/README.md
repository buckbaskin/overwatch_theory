# Brigitte

Hero comparisons for fighting against Brigitte.

Soldier does ok if his aim is good. He needs to hit a lot of his clip then land
a helix rocket before reload. If he needs to reload, Brigitte should win. The
title is a little unclear, but in this case, Soldier is stunned for a second
before he can biotic field and do damage. At the shown accuracy, Soldier 76 dies
before he can kill Brigitte if he doesn't use helix (when she's below the red
line).

McCree wins if he uses a flashbang, otherwise he loses to Brigitte's one hit
combo (shield bash -> melee -> whip).
