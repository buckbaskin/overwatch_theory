# Brigitte

Hero comparisons for fighting against Brigitte.

Soldier does ok if his aim is good. He needs to hit a lot of his clip then land
a helix rocket before reload. If he needs to reload, Brigitte should win.

McCree wins if he uses a flashbang, otherwise he loses to Brigitte's one hit
combo (shield bash -> melee -> whip).
